# The Coding component

The Coding component is an integrated development environment for creating and editing scripts for your game.

It has all the features you would expect from an IDE; line numbering, syntax highlighting, auto-complete and many more! The best thing about the Coding component is that you don't have to leave your editor to edit your scripts.
