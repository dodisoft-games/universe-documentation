# Tutorial: AI

This project implements an **AI system for non-player characters (NPCs)** in a game. The system creates *realistic and dynamic NPCs* that can make decisions, navigate environments, and respond to changing conditions. At its core, the **Behaviour System** organizes actions into prioritized tasks, while the **NPC Controller** coordinates all capabilities like movement and target selection. NPCs have *personality traits* (aggressiveness, intelligence) that influence their decision-making, and a **Factor Monitoring System** tracks vital statistics like health and stamina to trigger appropriate reactions. This creates characters that can intelligently respond to game situations without needing explicit programming for every scenario.
