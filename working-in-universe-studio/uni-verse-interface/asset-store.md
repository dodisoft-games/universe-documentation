# The Asset Store component

The Asset Store component is probably the most important part of Uni-verse Studio as it allows you to develop your games quickly and efficiently. You can make your own game components, sell them in the Asset Store and earn Uni-credits, or you can spend your Uni-credits to buy components developed by others. Use these components as building blocks to create the game of your dreams!

You can buy and sell many different types of assets in the Asset Store: characters, models, animations, sounds, music, textures, scripts, scenes, effects, terrains and even complete games! Using your purchased assets in your game is very easy: all you have to do is to click Import after purchasing the asset you like.
