# The Project component

The Project component displays a list of all files, folders, and game assets that are available to you to make your game. Different types of files are represented by different icons to give you a visual hint. If you have a very ambitious project and it becomes really hard to find what you are looking for, you can always use the search bar on the bottom right corner to quickly access your files. You can also toggle the "Search Bundles" option to search for the file in your downloaded bundles from the [Asset Store](./asset-store.html)
