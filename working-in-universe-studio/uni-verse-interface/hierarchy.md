# The Hierarchy component

This component lists all your objects in your scene. Anything you put into your scene will be here: lights, cameras, objects etc. You can add more things into your scene simply by dragging and dropping from your Project component or by right-clicking into the Hierarchy component and choosing the appropriate action to create a light, a camera or an empty UniObject. An empty UniObject can be a functional in game object by adding the necessary scripts on it, or you can use it to organize your hierarchy.
