# Particle

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

The Particle window streamlines the process of creating dynamic visual effects for your game. Starting with a template provides you with a foundation of pre-configured settings, allowing you to quickly iterate and customize your effects. These templates serve as practical starting points for common effects like fire, smoke, explosions, or magical abilities.

Once you've created your particle system, a wide selection of properties awaits your fine-tuning. The duration setting controls how long your effect plays, while looping determines whether it repeats continuously or plays once and stops. Emission settings govern the rate and pattern of particle generation, fundamentally shaping how your effect builds and maintains itself.

Shape

The shape property defines the space from which particles emerge â€“ whether they burst from a point, spray in a cone, or emanate from a custom shape. 

Renderer

The renderer determines how individual particles appear, affecting their basic visual characteristics.

Velocity over life time

Velocity over lifetime influences how particles move through space, allowing for effects like gravity or wind.

Force over life time

Force over lifetime allows you to apply dynamic forces to your particles as they exist, creating effects like gravity, wind, or magnetic attraction that can push, pull, or swirl your particles in various directions throughout their lifespan.

Color over life time

Color over lifetime enables smooth transitions between different hues, perfect for creating ethereal glows or dynamic explosions. 

Size over life time

Size over lifetime controls how particles grow or shrink as they age, while rotation over lifetime determines how they spin through their existence.
