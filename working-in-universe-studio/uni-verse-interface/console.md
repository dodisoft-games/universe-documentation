# Console

The Console component shows errors and warnings generated by the editor. It's basically your game trying to communicate with you. It's very natural in game development to make mistakes, and when you make any, the editor will tell you what's happening and will give you hints on how to fix it in this component. When your game is happy, you'll see green texts in this window just like the screenshot below:

![Console]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/content/images/console.png)

This component is quite simple; there is only 3 buttons to interact with it:

1. **Clear**: Gets rid of the text that's occupying the Console component so that you can better focus on the incoming messages.
2. **Export**: Saves the messages in a text file so that you can share it with co-workers, customer support or other fellow developers on the internet to get help with your problem.
3. **Enable**: Enables or disables messages from your game.
