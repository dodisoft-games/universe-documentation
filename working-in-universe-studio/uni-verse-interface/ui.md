# UI

The UI component offers two main functionalities.

### UI Builder

The UI Builder is a visual tool for constructing your game's user interface. You can create the perfect UI for your game via dragging and dropping common UI elements onto your screen such as:

- Images
- Buttons
- Text fields
- Input fields
- Dropdowns
- Checkboxes
- Sliders
- Virtual joysticks
- Scoreboards

You can also define actions and assign keyboard (or mouse, or game controller) shortcuts to these actions.

### Icon Editor

The Icon Editor allows you to create and manage sets of icons for use in your UI.
